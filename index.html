            <h1>Happy 11th Monthsary, Raine!</h1>
            <p>
                As I write this, may naghihintay na mga reviewer sa'kin HAHAHAHA but still, I'll always make time for you. Super stressful and kinakabahan kasi puro exam kami bukas, but, just the mere thought of you makes me feel like everything's gonna be okay lang. I remember the first time you made me feel that way, same situation, midterm rin namin HAHAHA I was panicking then nag chat ka "hoy baks". Nawala na lang sa isip ko yung exam and nakipag chikahan sa'yo kasi everything's gonna go well naman, everything's gonne be alright. 11 months later, I still feel the same and forever will feel the same. You inspire and motivate me to do better. I love you and... <br><br>
                ..you are my universe and my brightest and the prettiest star. My light in the dark, my yellow in this sorrow.
                <br><br>
                Put your volume up and enjoy.
